The staff is extremely rude and the owner does not follow through. Tonight, in fact, one of the employees, Emily, asked inappropriate questions while I tried placing a delivery order. She became indignant and I cut off the order and conversation. I read many of the other reviews and it's obvious that they have a big problem with their delivery system and staff. The owner, Giuseppe P, takes no interest or responsibility.",

      "rev_text": "Unfortunately, they're only good at pizza. They make a very homely hoagie... the lettuce is cut to be in a salad and so are the tomatoes- way too bulky. Same for peppers and pickles. Nothing fit in the roll and it was very soggy after a 4 minute drive home. Honestly doesn't even measure up to the worst wawa experience you've had. The wings are total crap. Always looking for a place that does a decent wing. These are rubbery and shapeless. Not convinced it's from a chicken. Bone and tendon break into every bite attempt. Yuck. And the Stromboli would have fine if it were cooked. My mind is a little blown. Looks good on the outside and waaaaaay undercooked inside. Like mostly raw dough.. huge globs of it. I've always liked their pizza but after today I think they've lost that business as well. Do yourself a favor and order from Carlos Pizza on Moreland road. Whole menu is great and after 25 orders living near by, never a bad experience. Nice people working in Mr P but that was awful and my stomach now hurts. Avoid.",

They even stay food when you order for delivery, or eat cold straight out of the fridge the next day.

Once I noticed the crunch I wanted to know what was I biting on that was so hard. BOOM A NAIL. I was so sick to my stomach I threw up the  pizza and ran to look for my boss and managers. I called the Mr.P's and I asked if the owner could call me and she took my information down and I'm still waiting for a phone call !!! We called again for the owner's name and we struggled to get that from them. The woman at the store called me back and asked me what I wanted of course my boss wanted a refund and I told her I wanted to speak with the owner and she said okay. Oh yeah, clearly they did not believe me because she went on to say all of our workers wear gloves! Let's not forget it's a whole pandemic going on and I found a nail in my mouth after I ate some of my pizza !!! I had to leave work early because I was so sick to my stomach! I couldn't even go to my second job because I was sick! So I lost money yesterday because of this ! My stomach still hurts and I woke up this morning vomiting.",

I ordered a slice of the meat lovers deep dish, my trusty companion had the veggie deep dish.   We decided to eat it there since the place was empty. The cashier brought it over to us when it was ready. I was about halfway into my slice when I noticed that the requisite garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes condiments were across from us on a shelf over the trash can. A lot of them. Insert thinking emoji here. They weren't at the counter where you pay and they were not on any tables. Why there? Annoying.  I also found it funny that I watched a man make a fresh stromboli, put it in the oven and then burn the hell out of it. Then he dumped the whole mess in a trash can which I didn't think was wise. Neither did a co-worker of his because he started poking at it with a stick I guess to make sure the can didn't burst into flames. The pizza was delicious though.",

I ordered delivery and around the ETA of the pizza, I get a phone call from the delivery girl who says she can't find the place. She said she was filling in and couldn't work a GPS. I guess she ended up in Jenkintown somehow? I dunno. Long story short, we finally got frustrated and had to pick up our food.  Upon getting home, we realized that the pizza is cold.

Yes we wanted them to send it, as we had already paid for it. It took close to 2 hours to get all of the food. They were unapologetic. Delivery and service were awful and food was subpar at best. Margherita pizza was awful and fries were bland. We will never be ordering from there again - too many other places in the area that are much better.",

The pizza is never wet and droopy and while pizza from other places is a bit too salty, Mr. P's pizza is balanced very well. Their meatball pizza is a favorite and their plain cheese even really good. Reheated in the toaster oven, the pizza tasted even better for leftovers. I did try the East Norriton location and I have to say they built their pizza differently but it was the same ingredients. For taste and really good dough and crust, I would recommend this place.

I will not say that this is the last time that I order from here as this was a one off experience with Mr. Ps.  The service is usually consistently good.  However, I do want to voice my displeasure with the service that I received this evening. Mr. Ps., please do a better job servicing your unsatisfied customers.",

They must have 15 pizzas sitting out on the counter all in varying levels of staleness. I asked the older gentleman behind the counter if maybe they had something that had recently came out of the oven and he looked over the old pizzas and said no. Everything sitting out looked old and dry.   I refuse to eat junk food that isn't fresh and tasty. I've officially given up on this place.",

      "rev_text": "This was about two years ago. My friends and I, along with our children, all stopped in for dinner one evening. We were four adults and four children. We all ordered drinks which were served promptly. We then ordered our food. We got to talking and eventually realized it had been 45 minutes since we ordered! It wasn't busy - half the tables were empty - but our waitress was nowhere to be found.   I went up to the counter and asked about our food. They looked confused and told me we hadn't ordered any. They offered to take my order a second time, but I declined and asked to just pay for the drinks. The kids were getting bored and antsy and it was a school night, so we couldn't stay longer.    Well, that's when it went from bad to worse. The guy behind the counter who I assume was the owner got FURIOUS. He started yelling at me to just leave. I pointed out that I hadn't paid for the drinks yet. \"Don't bother. Get out!\"   ?????????  All this in front of my kids and friends and the other patrons in the restaurant. I asked \"What is your problem?\" He said, \"You are a bad person!\" Uh. Ok. Because I can't wait any longer for the food you forgot to make? I told him he was nuts and ushered my kids out the door.   Needless to say, we have never been back.",

We understood because they probaly got busy and we weren't to upset about that, just hungry! The food arrived cold and mess! I ordered chicken parm dinner. The breaking on the 1/4 thick chicken all fell off and the pasta was just sitting in a bowl of watery red sauce. It was so unappetizing and not flavored at all. My husband ordered a Stromboli and that was cold but he said was also not flavored and tasted like it was cooked previously and just sat. We will definitely not be giving them anymore of our business. Just plain gross food!",
