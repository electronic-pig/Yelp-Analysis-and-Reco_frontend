Today, since I am eating low carb, I got the California omelette. Chicken, avocado, cheese, etc. it comes with toast and home fries, neither of which I wanted. Smart waitress offered sliced tomatoes, which I gladly accepted. Good call.  Previous visit, I got the eggs Benedict. Superb!  Absolutely top quality. Came with dish of fresh fruit, which for February/March in PA was pretty good. Great breakfast sandwich on menu. Egg was perfectly cooked. Also breakfast quesadilla ordered by my dining partners were all sampled by me, of course. All were very good. Also the cheesesteak omelette for the hearty appetite is highly recommended. If you love a side of scrapple, get it. I always do!  It's a bit $$ but worth it. Share it with someone and it's the perfect side.  So my advice to Jules E is to go back for brekkie and let me know?",

Dispute all the hang ups the staff that fed us was kind and hardworking one of party asked to speak to the manager but he never made it to us !

We've eaten there often over the last two years (mainly brunch) The atmosphere is nice, not too fancy not too laid back. The staff is usually attentive(the waitresses are usually nice but the girl that makes reservations on the weekends is usually rude.Not sure if she still works there.) The last two times we went we weren't impressed with the service because we made reservations for brunch and brought our whole family only to be told they they stopped serving breakfast by the time the waitress got to our table. Then the last time we went we were in a rush and we told the hostess/waitress but things still took so long that we ended up missing our appointment.   Lets get to the food: The fruit is usually fresh and the French toast with blueberry cream cheese is to die for! Their portions are decent and I've never had a meal there that I didn't like. I also like that they typically have things going on like Santa for Christmas, mother day menus and Valentine's Day, etc.   All in all, we will probably keep going back for the food alone.",

As a server myself, I am pretty understanding and patient when the service is slow during a lunch or dinner rush; however the restaurant was half empty, the drinks and food took forever! I even had to ask for silverware after we finally got our food. Our server was unapologetic that our three salads took about 45 mins, and I had to ask the manager to close my check so that I could leave. And to finally give this restaurant one star, a few hours after I got home from this restaurant, I started feeling some effects of food poisoning. I was expecting this restaurant to be great but it was a total waste of my time and money. I will not be going back.",

            "rev_text": "I had gone to the nearby hospital after being ill for a few days, and was told to eat soft food for the rest of the week.  My sister drove me so I suggested we go to Kitchen Bar  for lunch because I had eaten there before, and the sandwiches were pretty good.  The selection was pretty sparse for what I had to work with (not their fault) so I ordered a hummus appetizer,  a side of mashed potatoes and a side of plain broccoli.  I thought these were pricey but figured (incorrectly) that the portions would be decent.  My sister got a cup of crab soup and a side of grilled veggies.  The hummus appetizer, for $8.00 consists of a scoop of hummus and two pita breads. The sides were served in small dishes, much like those in diners that  would hold some coleslaw.  There was about one cup of very plain mashed potatoes, and pretty much the same amount of veggies.  Not a problem except that each side was four dollars each.  Really?  My sister had one cup of coffee and I had one cup of tea. The bill came to almost $32.00.  This is ridiculous. If you want good red pepper hummus, go down the street to Trader Joes, delicious and about two bucks.  They didn't even ask if we wanted the appetizer that was left. Overpriced for the mediocre offerings.",

Something was obviously wrong with the Guinness tap because it poured like crap. $7.50 for a flat drought. The crab bisque seemed like imitation crab. I have no proof other than the fact that I eat crab bisque all the time and can always tell. The burger was cooked perfectly and so were the fries. So if I ever go back it would be for a mixed drink and a burger at the bar. No Guinness and no crab bisque",

The best part of the thai wraps was the peanut sauce because the meat in the wraps weren't seasoned well. The Ahi tuna was good. I definitely enjoyed the kitchen burger. The meat was cooked perfectly and the combination of the bleu cheese, bacon, mushrooms, and sauce mixed well together. The entree comes with fries as a side but I got the sweet potato fries for an additional cost. The only downside of this burger was that it got soggy really quick. By the time I got to the second half of my burger, it was already falling apart. 4 stars bc I enjoyed the flavors of the burger though!",

We sat with our friends at a table for close to 10min without any menus. We were patient knowing they were busy.  The server came over and said she'd bring us water.  That was many minutes later still without the menus... Again we were not bothered by this, but should have know this was a clue.  She finally gave us menus and small glasses of water after telling her we only wanted water to drink.  The children's drinks arrived long after our waters did. We were seated directly next to the server drink station too.  Our appetizers arrived promptly, but our food took forever.  It also arrived in piece meals which is so wrong.  The kids meals were cold and our server had to be asked for condiments, napkins and water refills (repetitively).  It's something I take pride in when I wait tables, taking the initiative and bringing the guests what they need before they ask.    When our food finally arrived it was ok/good. My friend and I shared the fish tacos and lettuce wraps. We got the fish tacos when the kids meals arrived,  but lettuce wraps long after our husbands food arrived.  there was a good 5-10 minutes between them all arriving. She never came back to check on us after the food sever delivered the food.  My friend and I wanted plates since we were sharing and since we didn't see her to ask,  we used small bread plates instead.  We asked for water, again, and she came back with 1 glass for myself, but we all wanted more water. That literally took another 5 minutes. She was far from attentive and didn't care to turn her table over fast to make more money. We sat down at 530 and left at 735.  Im pretty sure ill never go back.",

Due to the convenient location we really want to like it, but are consistently disappointed.    The service was super slow.  I would have had an extra beer if the waitress had come back to check on us in 20 minutes or so.  Although, the beer list is also extremely weak with Sam Adams Oktoberfest being the only seasonal beer on tap.  Apparently they didn't get the memo that there are literally hundreds of local craft breweries brewing festbiers, pumpkin ales, and other delicious fall beers right now.  Harpoon UFO is not one of them.  The chicken fingers have a weird processed flavor to them.  The buffalo sauce tastes like it came right out of a bottle.  The coconut shrimp have a weird frozen fishy flavor to them and come with a Thai Chili sauce that also tastes right out of a Franks bottle and canned pineapples.  The worst was a the Buffalo Chicken BLT pizza that had yellow tomatoes on it.  I asked my wife if they bought their tomatoes at Wendy's, because the quality was about the same.  I think part of the problem is this place doesn't know what it wants to be.  The interior atmosphere has a nice, upscale kind of feel, but the menu has the schizophrenia of a diner menu.  Is it Greek?  Is it Italian?  Is it Asian? Is it new American?  All of those items are on the menu, and as a result they don't do any of them particularly well.  Unfortunately, as much as we want to like this place we won't be back until we hear they're under new ownership.",

Sadly, Kitchen Bar isn't up to that challenge. I live nearby & have gone many many times only because it's convenient. Every time I leave after a meal, I wonder why I keep going back. The food is consistently sub-par & over priced. The drinks, atmosphere, & service are very good however.",

My food came out and everything on the plate was burnt and oily..the bagel was hard as a rock and inedible. The omlet was brown and definitely over cooked, yet the spinach still managed to be raw and the cheese unmelted.  Our server Jesse was inattentive and did not mention the daily specials or offer the table water. The only highlight of the meal was my cup of coffee, which was thankfully fresh.",

            "rev_text": "Oh Kitchen Bar... I lived in Abington for 3 years as a student, and I have experienced everything Kitchen Bar has to offer, breakfast, lunch, dinner and nightlife.   Let me start the review by recounting the two unacceptable experiences I had at Kitchen Bar.   First, at lunch I ordered nachos, and the cheese on the nachos came out with mold on it. There is just no excuse for this, and when I complained and showed the mold to the server, they refused to comp the nachos. I had to argue with a manager to get them to nix the nachos from the bill.   Second, I ordered a burger, and there was hair in my fries. This one is unacceptable, but not as bad as the moldy nachos. I requested a new plate and was provided with one.   Breakfast:   I've always enjoyed the breakfast, I feel the quality of the food is at its peak during the weekend morning rush.   Lunch & Dinner:   Aforementioned issues occurred at lunch and dinner. The food quality is at its lowest during these times. I would never eat at Kitchen Bar during these times again.   Nightlife:   The music is way too loud. Despite being close to a college campus, the average age of the person going to Kitchen Bar at night is over 40. If that's your demographic great, you may enjoy yourself. If not, there are better bars with cheaper drink prices and less ostentatious DJ's to satisfy your nightlife experience.",

I stopped in for lunch with a friend. I ordered a raspberry margarita, which I've had on multiple occasions. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and when they finally did, our food came out a moment later. The restaurant was not crowded. My drink was incorrect; it definitely wasn't a margarita...tasted more like a martini, so I sent it back and luckily was able to replace it with a sangria. I ordered a turkey burger; it was not as fresh as it normally is -- it seemed like someone had microwaved a frozen patty, rather than the quality of food I'm used to at Kitchen Bar. Our server was unfriendly, not super attentive and didn't seem too concerned with the wait time for drinks or the incorrect drink. I'll come back and give Kitchen Bar another try because I've had so many other positive experiences, but today's lunch experience was not a good one.",

Our server was over quickly and took drink orders, then came back soon after for the dinner order. No complaints here. I've had better martinis for sure, but this wasn't bad. I was craving one and it satisfied the craving.   I ended up with the chicken pita, which is pretty much what it sounds like. I was a little let down here, as it was very dry...I kept wondering where the tzatziki ended up, and then I found out...it was all in the opposite end. Oh well. The Greek Salad that came with it was suitable...feta and olives make me happy, I guess.  My companion loved her meal, so maybe I just got a dud. As others noted the decor is a bit overboard (especially in the bathroom), and doesn't suit the area so much. Of course this decor brings higher-than-average prices, and with that I must deduct a star. They earned big points for prompt and attentive service, and I will probably return at some point, but I wasn't blown away, all things considered.",

The menu looked pretty good but I was a bit nervous bc of the wishy washy reviews on yelp.   So we decided to take a chance...and we were not disappointed! I had the total seduction drink made with tequila and ginger soda. Mmm! He had a Bloody Mary which is weird bc it was dinner time but to him it was morning bc he had just woken up.   We split the calamari app and it was typical except they also threw in some fried jalapeño slices which really made the dish de-lish! For my main course I went with something oh ought was going to be on the lighter side- Greek grilled chicken salad. It was awesome! Calamata olives, tons of feta, perfectly warmed pita bread. And it was HUGE! I couldn't even finish.   My boyfriend is a fine dining chef and therefore extremely hard to please when it comes to food. He was actually very impressed with his dish. He has the broiled striped bass filet topped with crabmeat. It was very delicious.   All said and done we had a positive experience. I really liked the decor and layout of the place and out server Katie was very helpful.  I would love to return for breakfast bc they seemed to have some great choices there as well! The only thing that was a little annoying we're the prices. I thought they were a little strap for the type of establishment it was.",

            "rev_text": "My husband and I have enjoyed going to The Kitchen Bar for a couple years! The buffalo wings are so good here, which is a go to food choice for us there. They also have great cocktails. Recently, I decided to throw hubby a surprise birthday party there. I was directed to Margaret, and she went above and beyond to help me set up the party! She offered to lay out nice linen tablecloths, along with having fresh flowers on the tables!  On the day of the party, when I came with decorations prior, Margaret was so sweet to help me set it all up! Leon, the owner even stopped by to offer to help and set up a barrier to help ensure hubby would not see everyone waiting to surprise him! Again, above and beyond! The waitress was also great, and provided great service!  I definitely recommend checking out the kitchen bar! Additionally, karaoke on Thursdays is the best karaoke I have ever been too. The people singing are extremely talented, and the atmosphere is great! We have also had Richard a couple times in the past as a waiter, and he is top notch!",

Kitchen serves brunch on saturday and sunday (?) so off i went, convenient because my sister lives close by.   I got eggs benedict and coffee, while my mom got pancakes. Eggs were way too runny, and the hollandaise was alright. Pancakes were, pancakes. Fluffly, tasty.   My ultimate review would be on the lunch I had on a different visit. We had the special shrimp and rice entree, and it was very good. Rice was cooked al dente which, i really like.   All in all, if in the area i would dine here again, but not a \"seek out\" visit. As far as service goes, you can hang it up. The servers treat you like they get paid hourly, not off tips.",

Our entrees arrived 5 minutes after our appetizers. I requested no sun dried tomatoes in the topping for my dinner. Rather than telling me it was pre-mixed, he brought the topping on a separate plate... in case I was allergic.  My favorite part: when we tried to flag down another waitress to pay our check, she thought we were just being REALLY friendly from across the room... so she smiled, WAVED BACK and kept on walking.  For our troubles, the manager gave us a coupon for our next visit, one that requires a receipt from a car wash.   Come on, Kitchen Bar, do better!",

Weird but ok, then the food took over 30 minutes, not sure how long it takes to drop chicken fingers and fries in the fryer but yeah it took that long to bring to our table.

We decided to share some appetizers for our food. Out of 3 appetizers,  we finished one, had some of another, and completely returned the 3rd to the kitchen. The food all tasted like it had been cooked before, and then reheated. The meat in the returned item (Philly mac and cheese) was so chewy you couldn't get through it, plus it tasted like bad hamburger helper. Definitely NOT gonna give this place another shot.",

The last visit however was unpleasant as I was asked to remove my baseball cap while waiting for my meal.  It seems to me it doesn't make sense to ask patrons to remove their sports caps in what I perceived to be the sports bar section of the establishment.  I'm guessing people wear their caps to a sports bar.  If there were such a misguided policy you'd think it'd be posted, or the hostess would inform you when seating you.  Not only that, I detected another patron wearing their cap without interference until I pointed that out to the \"bouncer\".  I couldn't help but believe I was being \"profiled\" - singled out for special treatment.  Don't know why they would do that but it's enough to make me say \"I won't be back\".",

I would have wanted to give this place more stars but past their pretty cool design, they have very average food and a service staff that is clearly overworked.  Our party of 5 arrived at 9:30 on Sunday and we were promptly seated.  We were able to get through the menu quickly and order and that's where the service fell out a bit.  We got through the microcups of coffee pretty quickly and had to actively seek out our server to get more.  We had the same problem with the water, which the menu told we \"had to ask for specifically.\"  My california omelet had a very generous helping of guacamole on it, but the chicken inside was bland the omelet as a whole was just nothing to write home about.  The toast was generic as well.  The grits were tasty so I can give a plus for that.  I imagine that there aren't many places like Kitchen Bar out in the burbs so I'm sure they have a very regular brunch crowd.  I wanted to like this place more but all the pieces are working in sync.",

Since we were for breakfast, I didn't mind so much.  My omelet was good, but the plating didn't match the decor. I think I'd rather just go to a regular diner.  We may try it again for diner, but the restaurant is kind of forgettable, so I say that dinner may not happen for quite some time.",

            "rev_text": "Went on Sunday with my boyfriend and his grandmother - she requested we try it out and as Vinny P. said below, \"I've experienced better\", though there are some good points.  The good: HUGE menu! 8 pages of breakfast, lunch and entrees to choose from. Beautiful sun porch to the side (which is where we sat). Plenty of parking. $3.50 Yards pints all day everyday. You can make any sandwich a wrap (I had the BBQ chicken in a wrap and enjoyed it).  The bad: Waitstaff seems efficient but not warm or happy (perhaps management isn't too kind on them?). The menu varies quite a bit in price and felt like the prices were gouged on over half of the menu. The portions on some dishes seemed off ~ my boyfriend got the blueberry stuffed french toast and it had only 2 slices of french toast and no sides with it. For $8, that seems silly. Also, they offer a whole page of omelets Mon-Fri ONLY - WTF? It's an omelet - just throw some stuff together and BOOM, you're good. Anyway, that omelet menu had the ones we wanted and the waiter told us NO - disappointing.   I wouldn't go there again due to the pricing and the waitstaff's all around depressed demeanor, but I wouldn't object if someone really wanted to go. The quality of food is good and they do have alot of options.",

            "rev_text": "I have been coming to the Kitchen Bar for several years and after my experience yesterday, I will not be patronizing this establishment again.  We started our meal with what has been my all time fav at the Kitchen Bar - French Onion soup.  Maybe it's me, but soup is suppose to be hot - not room temperature.  I don't like to send food back for fear of getting a little special sauce, so I dealt with it.  My husband ordered the french dip, which we have both had umpteen times.  This one was different and lacked flavor and his french fries were cold and chalky.  I ordered the chicken fingers and added the sweet potato fries to make it a meal.  The chicken fingers were overcooked, dry and COLD.  I figured I would take them home and heat them up for a snack the next day that was going to be a snow day.  Then I bit into one of the $4.99 sweet potato fries.  They were COLD.  I mean COLD!  At this point, I am ready to send both plates back, pay for what we ate and get the heck out of there.  However, I know that would have not been fair to our waiter.  So, against my norm, I asked him to have them prepare me a hot order of fries.  Not long after he brought a hot order of sweet potato fries.  I had given up on the chicken fingers so I asked our waiter for some honey for the fries.    He came back with a jar of ketchup and said that they did not have any honey.  WHAT?!!  They have a robust breakfast menu and they don't have honey!  I refuse to believe that.  My guess is that the honey gets put away at the end of the breakfast hours and they weren't interested in making the customer happy.  NOW, let me say that I have NEVER been served an order of sweet potato fries (usually fresh cut, but these were frozen) without some type of dipping sauce - typically honey, sour cream or some type of aioli.  I am done!  Evidently, they have changed something, perhaps kitchen staff who don't care anything about service and quality or maybe management who could care less as well.  Either way, The Kitchen Bar will not see me again.",

            "rev_text": "The minute we stepped inside of Kitchenbar, my fiance' remarked that it felt like a souped up diner.  At first. I didn't realize what he meant until I observed the wait staff was wearing UNIFORMS!!  None of the waitresses wear uniforms in any our favorite restaurants.  Second, our waitress had a lackluster attitude. She couldn't be more nonchalant. She barely spoke to us as she took our order and delivered our meals.  Third, the music they were playing was HORRIBLE! It seemed out of a place for a restaurant that, judging by the decor, was trying very hard to be hip!    However, when our FOOD came, there was no mistaking that this was absolutely NOT a diner. We both ordered the Encrusted Tilapia, which was (as described on their website), broiled tilapia encrusted with a blend of portobello mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, crispy potatoes and basil, drizzled with a scampi wine sauce, served with grilled vegetables.  It was soooooo good!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had been craving a good fish entree, and Kitchenbar delivered.  At 16.99 for our entrees, we thought Kitchenbar was reasonably priced.  For dessert, we had the Banana Caramel Xango, which was absolutely one of the best things I've put in my mouth...ever!!!! Without a doubt, we will return to Kitchen Bar.... there are so many other things on that menu I need to try!",

To start with the positive, it is a wonderful atmosphere, especially for younger crowds. The restaurant is modern and clean. They also have an extensive menu. Now for the bad. We went in on a Friday night, and the place was only half full. We were waited on by a man named who smelled like he had just gotten off a long smoke break. All I could think as I placed my order was \"I hope he washed his hands!\" He also messed up our order and denied to take any responsibility for it. He was very slow the entire night, and took forever to get water and the  check. Food is subpar at best. Very sad because the place has so much potential! Maybe new management is all it needs.",

My friends made reservation but they couldn't seat us till the whole party arrives which is fine but then 30 min later tells us we have to give up our table if they don't show up 15 min from the reservation time. There wasn't anyone waiting for a table at that time but they were giving us a hard time saying restaurant policy and that they already gave us extra time. It was also very late at night and the crowd died down so I didn't understand why the couldn't let it go. In the end we only had 5 people but they sat us at our 10 person table so I don't get what the fuss was about.",

            "rev_text": "I joined Yelp for the sole purpose of writing this review. I just came home from yet another disappointing experience at Kitchen Bar. This is my third and final meal at this restaurant. I think I have given it enough of a chance. I am always trying to support local business where ever I am and this one is just hands down really horrible.  I will review this last experience.  We walked in.  There were two people behind the desk. One woman, on the phone and one young man doing something with the menus.  Both of them stared at us and said absolutely nothing. The young man just stood there, staring and continued for at least (what seemed like a lifetime) a couple minutes. I said, \"hello\", and got no response. Finally, I asked the young man if we could just go sit at a table near the bar and he continued to stare. Then the girl got off the phone and I repeated, \"hey, can we just sit over by the bar\". She finally handed us menus and took us over there.  This is the funny part. We came in around 3:30pm. The place was empty. There were at least 10 servers sitting at the tables all over the restaurant. Yet, it took at least 10 minutes for anyone to come over to even great us. Finally a young man came over, introduced himself and  said that he would be back in a bit. No water. No silverware. Dirty table. I had to flag him down to get a drink menu. We waited again, for at least 10 minutes for him to come back and take our drink order. Not complicated. Isn't that what a server does? Finally he came back, no personality at all. I mean, nothing. Stone wall. He took our drink order. Then, we waited another 20 minutes for him to come back with our drinks and to take our food order. The drinks weren't anything to write home about. So...we waited...again...I think we spent more time in there doing nothing than we did actually eating. Isn't that what a restaurant is? An eating experience? Still there were tons of servers, standing around, doing nothing. I guess we walked in on social hour. But, aren't these people on the clock? Because at my job, I start working the moment I walk in. Anyway... We finally got our food. Things just placed on the plate. Nothing special. My friend got a Chipotle Turkey Burger that came with nothing on it. It was a turkey burger and a bun. She had to flag him down again, to ask where the Chipotle sauce was and the onions and the avocado and spinach was. He replied, \"ohhhh, you wanted a Chipotle Burger??? I didn't hear you say that\". Ummmm....there is only one turkey burger on the menu. And, that is the only one.  At this point, it was just bad. I didn't get my salad. Instead I got watery cole slaw aka cabbage and tiny bits of carrot slopped in a bowl. But, I just didn't want to deal with him anymore.  My friend got the burger and yet again, there was no chipotle sauce, spinach, avocado...etc...Great.  I mean, seriously. I work in customer service. I mean, I work for a company that is rated #1 in customer service. I get service crammed into my soul everyday. So, when I am out, all I have as an expectation is that the person (who applied and got a job working in customer service meaning, you chose this position) does at least their job. I don't need a server to be my best friend. I don't need a server to come over to the table every five minutes. Just do your job. This isn't the first time this has happened. And, friends and family have said the same thing. Instead of spending all this money making the place look pseudo-hip, spend the money on hiring staff that actually care about their jobs. Servers rely on tips to make money. That is your job. At least attempt to give a crap. I will never eat here again.   Thanks.",

Ended up here on a humbug with one of my besties and I can't figure out why we stopped coming. I Definitely enjoyed the crab wantons. Didn't really know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. They were delicious. The cheesesteak spring rolls were also pretty good. My friend had the crab benedict. She wasn't in love with it (asked for her eggs poached hard but that was overlooked) other than the eggs being not to her liking she felt that they just sliced her English muffin and didn't toast it. But she said the crab with the spinach was pretty good. Also had the handmade chips. They presentation wasn't all that and they tasted how they looked. Somebody might like them but I wasn't a big fan. Overall my experience was pretty decent and want to go back to try the pesto mussels. The meal wasn't to bad on the wallet and I was full when I left so no real complaints.",

It didn't end well for me. We did not finish our meal therefore we were given take out containers and a white plastic bag with a smiley face that said \"have a nice day\".  I was shocked to see this bag for several reasons.. 1- the type of establishment we were in.   2 - I noticed other parties with more appropriate take out bags that had the restaurants name written on them as I came in the restaurant and as we were leaving. When we asked if the plastic smiley face bag was there normal take out bags the host seemed confused and another offered to check to see if there were anymore of the \"regular\" bags. I left without any resolution. . Not that a bag is a big deal but.. What made us any different than the other paying customers? We felt insulted and unappreciated",

What I enjoy most is the large portions. It makes you feel like you're getting your money's worth. The taste of the food is good--flavorful and well-seasoned.   I ordered the seafood soup which was pretty good; it's not hearty but it has a great flavor and filling. I also ordered the pulled chicken sandwich entree. While the portions were good, this wasn't the best as it was overly sweet. With the sweet and tangy sauce, sweet cole slaw and a sweet mayo-ish sauce, the sweetness dominated the sandwich, making it unenjoyable. My friend ordered the ribs, mashed potatoes and broccoli, which was said to have been good.   The service was consistent and attentive.   Parking can be tight.",

If your in the area and do not want to go to one of the chain restaurants, this is a decent place.  Standard american styled food is what is served.  We had no issues with prompt service or food served improperly. I guess that makes this an average place.  And probably the one thing that sticks out, I really have no desire to return. I live locally and it is an option, but we often choose the chain places if it a meal out that was unplanned.  Parking is very limited, so be prepared. It is also kind of confusing the way they arranged it.  The one major let down, dessert. Nothing special here and not something to plan for.",

Crab wonton bites were beautiful but just ok despite the generosity of crab, the flavors just overwhelmed the crab; flatbread was really good; SHOW-STEALER was the baked feta cheese saganaki, this app is one of the most delicious dishes I've had.

Someone who likes to dance can enjoy the small dance floor without needing to completely leave their friends.  Meanwhile, someone who prefers the cool air of a summer night  can sit on the patio outside. The sports fan can catch a few updates from the games that evening.  And of course, the bar area provides a nice space for people who are more so on a solo mission.  However, the service leaves something to be desired.  It was clear that the staff was ready for everyone to leave.  The sign says that it closes at 2:00 a.m on Saturday but we got the \"its time to go\" sign at 1-right after last call.  The tv's were turned off and the music stopped.  I thought I read the sign wrong but apparently the 2 am closing time is flexible.  Its worth stopping by if you are in the area but get there early because they may close whenever the manager sees fit to do so.",

It was basically soup to the point I couldn't eat much of it so I tried he bourbon chicken from my bfs plate and it was just dry chicken covered in sauce. Not very good at all. I decided to take my pasta home in a Togo container and when I was tilting the plate to let the oil drain to the other side and scoop the pasta into my container the waiter grabbed the plate out of my hand and was like let me help you. It didn't help. I managed to spill pasta on then table and he was tilting the whole plate towards my container letting me take the oil home with me so at that point I took the plate back and said I got it. I had to seriously insist on doing it myself cause he was so determined to do it for me. The oily pasta upset my stomach and now I'm trying to give it a try for lunch to not let the food go to waste but I can't. There's no fixing it. I won't be back",

The Asian Bloody Mary I ordered was delicious, although I asked if the bartender could add extra wasabi, as it wasn't as spicy as described by the waitress. My ahi tuna salad was wonderful! It was so filling, which took me by surprise, as salads usually don't fill me up that much. I had a side of the home fries (weird combo, I know) and they were great.

What is not reasonable is that when I asked the waiter about it, he shoved the menu in my face to tell me that I was wrong, not him. He showed no attempt to solve the problem. He didn't offer me a different meal or even apologize. I ate about half the burger, which I knew I wouldn't like because of the sauce that was on it. The waiter noticed but did not do anything about it. I don't know how this place could employ a waiter like that.",

            "rev_text": "This is probably one of my least favorite restaurants I've ever been to. After being out and grocery shopping boyfriend & I worked up an appetite. We were going to go to Chef Vargas but this was on the way back so we decided to give it a shot. Walked in at about 11:30am and the place was a ghost town ON A SATURDAY! that should've been red flag number 1. When we walked in we weren't greeted. There were 2 women behind the hostess desk, one appeared to  be a manager. We literally stood there behind another guest while she figured out how to preform a refund of some sort. Neither her or the host said anything. After 10 minutes we were finally seated. Took another 10 minutes for our server to come over and she clearly didn't want to be there. Zero personality , we felt rushed and we hardly ever seen her. Anyway, after looking over the sticky and extensive menu I decided to get the crab Benedict, it took about 20 minutes to come and when it did IT WAS AWFUL. The egg was not a poached egg it was over cooked and about 30 seconds from being completely boiled, the crab was BLAND and the spinach that came on it was wet, bland and it soaked the English muffin which made it soggy and inedible. The home fries were over cooked MUSH. The bottom of the home fries were BUNRED and extremely crunchy and the rest was damn near mashed potatoes. I flagged down my server & I refused to eat it and ordered something simply thinking they couldn't screw it up. I ended up getting two eggs w/ bacon , toast and home fries. Yet again , the home fries were over cook as well as the eggs. It was pretty horrid, at that point we just ate paid and left. The kitchen is clearly clueless and he staff clearly miserable. It's not hard to tell that I won't be back ! This glorified diner is only getting 2 stars because I ordered a mimosa and it was delicious.",

First the positives: friendly hostess, good server, tables separated enough to have private conversation, presentation of sandwich was good, quality of ingredients average to slightly better than average.  Negatives: value for money ( $10 for a cheesesteak and a few chips?), menu not accurate (got sun chips not advertised potato chips, chicken was available but was not listed), soup of the day must be a secret because it wasn't shown and server didn't know it.  All in all a pleasant experience but they should make menu accurate and think how to improve value equation.",

When I went, the service was good...the food was well portioned and well prepared and palatable!  I really found the ambience to be sweet...not too much and not too little.   I hope that the place does not lose charm and try to compete with the Drake down the road.  I'm gonna return soon with a group and we'll see what the update looks like.",

One time we were waiting for an hour, and people who had been there for less time were getting seating before us. The third problem is that once we actually got a table the service was terrible.

The decor of this place is pretty swanky for a diner- the wall next to me was actually a waterfall, which looked nice but led to my right sleeve being soaked by the end of the meal and many frequent bathroom trips to tinkle. Next time I'll probably request a seat on the other side of the dining room. And the waitress was nice but kinda forgetful. Utensils and drinks are usually standard dining procedure, but maybe not in her book.   Two and a half stars for the food (it was good but pricy) and a half star for the amnesiac service.

            "rev_text": "Ok. I have lived right around the corner from Kitchen Bar for a year and never been because I could tell from the online menu that they don't cater to vegetarians. However, I was all set to go and enjoy a beer with friends.   My partner and I got suckered into going one night after our tennis class. We wanted to hang out with the group, and we were all coming in around 8:30 p.m. on a hot July weeknight, after playing tennis for two hours. Turns out, they have a dress code. And many of us didn't make the cut.   My problem with this is the snarky manager. The young hostess was polite and kindly informed the gentlemen in the group that they needed to wear sleeves and offered them shirts. It was matter of fact, and came rather maturely from the girl. Then the black-shirted manager swooped in to her rescue to kick out the men who \"don't shave their armpits or wear deodorant, like girls do.\" Really?   I would have left right then, had we not been meeting a group. Instead, the guys changed, and I overpaid for a beer and snacked on a plate of fried breading, aka zucchini chips. The \"chips\" were really spiralized zucchini -- really thin strips -- weighed down by heavy breading.   I won't be back.",

I was a bit annoyed that people came in after us, and got seated before us.  So negative marks for the hostess on Sunday.  The menu was large, but not much variety.  The waiter recommended a specific burger- was average at best.  I also had the nachos...again average at best.  The kids meals were actually the nicest looking meals.  Overall, there are much better places for lunch or breakfast.  The prices are too high for the quality of food and service.  I guess the prices are high to pay for the impressive decor.  Anyway, I have no need to go back again, unless maybe for drinks and appetizers, which I feel are probably the reason this place stays in business.  So t elsewhere, but have a drink here.  - MSZ",

Of course we understand that if it would disturb other guests, we would not be able to have our dogs on your premises. It tells me that you really didnt read our review. The issue is that I called 15 minutes before showing up and being told yes, we allow dogs, to showing up and having a rude waitress tell us no. There was one other table sat outside, so Im not sure where this miscommunication is. Thank you for your response.      We wanted to eat here today, well, my friend put it best I think.   Was with my friend and our dogs after a hike. Called and specifically and asked if the outdoor seating was dog friendly and was told they were. We drove 10 minutes over, had my friend wait outside with the dogs, walked in to a waiter counting in his tips at the host stand. Completely ignoring me for 5 minutes until an old woman came over and I said \"hello, we called about sitting outside with our two dogs\". She looked shocked and said they did not allow dogs. I told her we had just called prior to driving over and she shook her head no. I thanked her for wasting our time and left. Will never be back.   Absolutely infuriated by the lack of professionalism shown by the staff here.   Go to the Vintage, 2 minutes down the road. They allow dogs, and have excellent food and service.",

However, it is hard to pinpoint one thing on the menu that really stands out or really blows away your palate.

The wait staff seemed very busy at the time of my visit as refills were not given until the plates were cleared.    Overall, the food is decent, the drinks somewhat overpriced, and the wait staff somewhat understaffed. To put it lightly, this is a good place to go if it's Friday, you just got paid, and are looking to have a few drinks at a trendy spot with some good friends.",

            "rev_text": "I'm going to give Kitchen Bar three stars because of the food. The Chicken Marsala was delicious, not overly drenched in Marsala and not dry. My compliments to those working in the kitchen.   What I dislike about Kitchen Bar is the atmosphere. I've been there a few times in years past, and I remember it being kind of upscale family dining. But in my most recent visit I noticed, while still upscale seeming, I feel like this place is not sure if it wants to be a restaurant or a nightclub. They were pumping 1990s club music, loudly, throughout the restaurant which I found a little irritating. I added a picture of some art on the wall, which was just a silly painting but when your restaurant has artwork that's a play on a strip club, it furthers the notion that they're going for more of a party crowd, and less of a dining crowd. The service was slow and it didn't seem overly crowded. And the people sitting around us were loudly having a pretty vulgar conversation.   While that last part isn't necessarily within the restaurant's control, I feel like they were setting the atmosphere to invite that kind of lax attitude about what people around them would hear. It wouldn't bother me as much if I weren't trying to celebrate my wedding anniversary over dinner while trying to ignore that, but also trying to hear my wife over the loud beats, while waiting a long time for service.   I plan on giving Kitchen Bar another chance. This may just be an issue of circumstance, and I really do enjoy their food. And when I decide to go back, if my experience is different, I will gladly update my review.",

            "rev_text": "We are long time  residents of Elkins Park PA and almost daily are passing by the Kitchen Bar restaurant. Last time we ate there was some 16 years ago and  at that time we thought that the food was mediocre at best.Tonight, a rainy night we decided to give this venue another try. I must confess that this was our worst meal in then last 20 years. The food was almost not edible although the service was excellent. My Calamari dish had 22 pieced of   sliced jalapeño pepper in it. The calamari were heavily dipped with flour, soggy and flavorless.  My blackened Cod fillet were actually not filletes but probably frozen fish ( the menu states \"fresh fish daily\") smothered in a Gumbo  spice mixture and completely  raw and needless to say without any flavor. It was accompanied by single  gigantic buttered  Florette of broccli and a side of coleslaw floating in mayo. My wife's  Pomegranate Salad consisted of raw chicken breast over Romaine lettuce and few blueberries. We returned the \"grilled\" chicken to the kitchen to be redone.There were no grating marks on the \"grilled chicken\". Total bill $64.34 this included a glass of Cabernet.Total cost- including the tip-$77.00.   On my way out I asked the Owner-manager  when was the last time he tasted the food from his kitchen. His answer ...daily.",

I think they are trying to go for a modern sports bar feel near the bar area, but I've never seen guys in jerseys there getting nasty on wings.  Perfect for dates because it's just loud enough in there that the table next to you won't hear your conversation, and yet chic enough so it doesn't feel like a chain restaurant.  I do love that everyday of the week they have some kind of different food/drink special. They have everything ranging from a pizza buffet to $5 appetizers after 8 PM on Sun, and lots of drink specials. My favorite drink special is the pitcher of Jack for $7. Yes, it's an actual pitcher, so think like 3.5 drinks in one and have it with some lemonade, as our server suggested....splendid.  Appetizers: I've had a ton of their appetizers and really not loved any. I think the ones I like the most are the Philly cheese steak rolls and the coconut shrimp. Everything else just was ok.  Entree:  I did have a chicken gyro platter and I was highly impressed. The chicken is definitely not seasoned Mediterranean style (more like regular grilled chicken), but the tzasiki sauce was great and the side salad was excellent AND pretty!  Dessert: My boyfriend ordered the Xanga tower (I think it's called), it's basically filo dough filled with cheese cake, a side of ice cream and fruit garnish. It did have good flavor, but nothing abnormally fantastic - personally I'd order another pitcher of Jack. :)  I do enjoy the red decor and high bar tables. The bartender always pours a good drink and they have cute outside seating for when you need to go make-out.",

The moz sticks were cold (has been cooked but evidently waited until the fries were done to bring them out), so were the sweet potato fries (also under cooked) and the onion rings were barely fried. When we FINALLY saw our waitress again to let her know, she shrugged her shoulders and said a barely polite sorry and left. It wasn't our point to have anything removed from the bill, but there wasn't even an attempt to apologize or anything. We WILL NOT be going back.",

I went in with low expectations as eating out during holidays like Mother's Day are notoriously awful, but this was just beyond bad.    The service was slow but not just slow unapologetic.  No apologies for taking over 1.5 hours to get meals, no apologies for inedible cold food, nothing. I understand its a busy day, but at least apologize if eggs that are supposed to be hot come out cold and offer to have them heated up! NOPE NOTHING.  The waiter barely acknowledged us when we mentioned the food was cold and couldn't eat it.  Again, I get that its a busy day, but a little acknowledgment would have gone a long way.  Had to ask multiple times for silverware. Someone in our party had to go to multiple other tables to collect enough silverware for everyone to be able to eat.  Had to find our own box to take food home. The only thing they were fast about was bringing the check and running the credit cards.  Needless to say I won't be returning here for any future family events or affairs.",

Sure, it's expensive here, but if you treat it as a bar first, you'll get a lot more mileage out of it.  Still, the biggest con is the price. (Like 10 bucks for two spring rolls? They're good spring rolls, but not five dollar a piece ones). There really isn't an entree for less than fifteen dollars. And while the food is good, it's not 'great'.   Aside from that I do really like the interior of the restaurant, they have some weird art going on, so that's a small consolation. And like I said, service has always been good.

The vegetable soup du jour that came with the meal was just salty, nothing special. The panini had a thick piece of grilled chicken in it that was both VERY dry and VERY bland. Even salt and pepper couldn't save it. The moussaka was super bland too. We upgraded the other soup to a house salad, which was the only enjoyable dish we had.   Albeit we didn't try anything from the regular menu; but at the very least would not recommend it for its lunch menu.

Additionally, our guests were appreciative of the quality of the meal, the venue service, as well as the ease of parking.

The good morning sandwich is an egg, cheddar cheese, and bacon breakfast sandwich, served on a light fluffy bun, with a side of breakfast potatoes. Both meals are delicious and did not disappoint!  The service here can be iffy. It seems that whenever I am seated at the high top tables on the left side of the restaurant that the service takes forever.

We were forced to take most of the food home.  The waiter lacked training in timing and the whole while assured us several times over 20 minutes that \"the food is coming soon\".

Our server was efficient and our appetizers were good, (We went with a spinach dip and dirty chips), but it was downhill from there. We placed a relatively easy order of mostly burgers and I went with  the trusted crab cakes. Ugh! Out came odd burger patties on an uber big roll. Where was the beef? One person's burger was undercooked, the fries were lukewarm, my mashed potatoes were inedible, and the crab cakes were fried too hard and not nearly as scrumptious as I've been accustomed to. I couldn't or wouldn't finish them and  no one wanted doggie bags. So disappointing. Is it under new management? Was the kitchen unprepared for the graduation crowd? My tummy still feels weird from that meal. I'll need time to forget about that visit before I return.",

The decor, I can describe it as sort of a retro feel, circa 1960's with a hip feel to it.  Wood surfaces and chairs combined with shiny metal, interesting geometric shaped lamps, etc.  I like different, so I warmed up to the KB as I walked in and took a seat.    Had a great appetizer and drink before my meal. I recommend the Philly Cheesesteak Spring Rolls to start out with (see photo)...what a new twist on two favorites, and a tasty app!  Very good stuff.  I also tried one of their specialty drinks, the Loco Raspberry Margarita...two thumbs up.  For my main entree, I got the Chicken Marsala.  It was great as well, it didn't last very long on the plate once it arrived.  The menu is very diverse, many different entrees for any taste or preference.  Service was good and friendly, if not a bit busy and hurried but that means business was good.    Overall, a unique and tasty stop if you get the chance to go.",

The issue I had was that we had to wait 10 minutes after being seated at a table for a server to come greet us. This was a Wednesday night so it wasn't crowded, and there were two servers handling the dining room. When we did get the attention of one of the servers, he apologized and claimed he didn't know he had our table. I  don't know how that works as when you come in for your shift as a server, you typically go to the host stand and find out what your section is. Also, when I worked as a server, if I saw someone sitting a long time with no drinks, I'd offer to get them drinks at least so they don't walk out and then I could locate their server. If I didn't have a business lunch here, I would've left. For dinner I had the quesadilla as I wasn't too hungry - I thought it did taste good. My dining companions enjoyed their meals which was the cheesesteak egg rolls and the salmon salad.",

Beverages and the homemade potato chips arrived in an average time frame. We continued to wait for our food. Tables around us began to fill and we watched those tables get their food. At one point, another tables food was brought to us and we said it wasn't ours. My husband was given the turkey club but then it was taken away because they said it wasn't his. After at least 45 min and watching everyone around us eat, we got up to leave. I asked to see the manager and explained the situation. He apologized but went on to charge us for the sodas and appetizer. What establishment does that? Not only did he charge me but charged someone else's $51 bill instead of the $21. After he messed up, he went and got the owner? Not sure or another manager. She apologized for us not eating and the wrong amount charge but still made us pay. The handling of this was all wrong. I had just mentioned this place to coworkers for a Happy Hour but I'll never patronize this place again and I will encourage others to stay away as well.",

I love French Onion soup and often consider myself to be a bit of a connoisseur...this was honestly one of the best I've had in a long time.  I also had the Greek salad wrap and - ok I did take it out of the wrap, so it was really a Greek salad with gyro - but so, so delicious!  We started with the roasted red pepper hummus, which was really good, but we were both a bit surprised that we didn't get more pita with the enormous scoop of hummus.  Our server did offer more when she saw we were getting low, though, so all good there.  Dining companion had the fish and chips, which looked great.  He enjoyed all four pieces of fish, but I didn't see him eat a single chip.  They looked good, but maybe he just doesn't like chips.  I dunno.    Our service was decent and it's a really cute place.  All in all I was totally pleased with Kitchen Bar and only wish I could have tried a few more things, as the menu has tons of choices and plenty of things that sounded good.",

There were a lot of people in the restaurant and it appeared like our waiter was waiting all the tables and was alone on the floor. So when it came time to get drinks, food etc, it took a long ass time!   When it came to the drinks, they tasted okay, but weren't anything spectacular. We had ordered a few apps which included nachos and a spinach dip, and the chips were stale, and the dip was watery. Not a great start! The nachos were huge and shareable, but they weren't the best either.   The drinks were very strong which was a good thing, and I wondered why they would make them so strong! Prob so people would be drunk quickly and wouldn't taste the garbage they were serving to customers and calling it food.   We had an issue with on of our drinks and complained about it, and were told they would make a new one for us, only to wait our entire meal waiting for our drink to come out.   One cool thing about this place, they had a DJ setting up! but we didn't stay long enough to enjoy the music cause our expereince was already a bust!",

Even after I spoke to the waiter and Dj , it again stayed load. We left.  Now this being out 1 st date AND wanting a place where u could hear each   But we split.  I feel that u  could change music style and then at say 10-10:30pm then u leave or get up on ur dancing feet. Just a thought. For a first date it was good ( good distractions if conversation isn't going well ( did)  and bad : music way to loud, way to early in the evening to be able to talk & listen to each other or stare hopelessly into ur date's big blue eyes.... as if!!!! Lol. Anyway looking forward to going back as soon as THE BIG BAD Wolfe ( governor that is) let's we Pennsylvanians out of being \" grounded\". Lol",

The sauce was so thick and thickened to the consistency of cake frosting as it cooled (quickly). The hollandaise sauce was obviously from a mix and tasted overcooked.  The server never checked with us to see how things were after they were served and by the time he got to me and I told him that I was having trouble eating it because it was so thick he asked me if I needed \"any additional tools\".  LOL... what the heck does that mean?  Also, I had a mimosa, which was good, but when I requested a second, the server returned to inform me they were \"out of mimosas\".  Okay, whatever.",

Two totally not what we'd ordered and one prepared incorrectly.   So three of the seven walked out without having eaten dinner including me, a mother of four and Im still hungry and on Mothers Day!!

Cream of Crab soup was to die for.  I ordered the special - T-Bone Steak for $24.99.  It was absolutely insulting.  It was the thinnest cut of steak that I have ever seen.

The potatoes served with it were dry as can be.  The fresh grilled vegetables, however, were perfect.  My husband's dinner was no better.  When the server came around, I told her how bad the steak was.  She said, \"I'm sorry.  Can I offer you a free dessert?\"????  Really???

I had the vegetarian burger, which was excellent. The sweet potato fries were wonderful. The decor in the restaurant Is very pretty, especially the color changing fountain on the wall.  Good drink special, the margaritas were 5$. Only bad thing was that our waiter was slow and took forever to bring us the check.",

            "rev_text": "Just left Kitchen Bar with a party of 7 plus a toddler.  One in my party is disabled and uses a special walker/chair.  I have been going to this place since its inception and everything seems to have drastically declined.   1.  They put together a large round table and pushed next to it a small square/rectangle table usually for two.  It was an awkward configuration at the end of the isle.   When I saw it,  I asked why they did not just put two of the longer rectangular tables end to end for our party.  Hostess answered:  Manager told me to do it.  I suggested that the other approach would be better for our party and she ignored me and walked away. 2.  The next party that came in that was large they did exactly what I had suggested--for them.  3.  The 'two' table was very wobbly.  Manager came over, pushed it back and forth a few times and said she would get another table.  She never did and we fixed it ourselves so it would stay still.   4.  When our food arrived, all lunch items, one of our party did not get her food.  It did not  arrive for 15 minutes.  My hamburger, which I ordered without onions as I am allergic, came out with onions (but no tomato which was  supposed to be with the lettuce).   5. When one of our party, the woman who waited so long for her turkey club, drank her unsweetened ice tea down to about 1/2 of the glass she noticed a crusty ring around the inside of the glass.  She did not notice it before because of the color of the tea.  She tested it with her knife and it was definitely crusted inside the glass in a ring.  I called the waitress over and showed it to her,  clearly the glass had been refilled dirty.  I saw our waitress then talking to Margaret, the Manager about it and then she disappeared.  Margaret walked over and stood next to us and said 'How is everything here?\".  I said you know about the glass --what kind of question is that?  Her answer \"we will take the ice tea off the bill.  That was it , no concern, no outrage, no comment about what they were doing in the dish washing area to make sure this would not happen again etc.  None of what you would expect  a manager to do or say.   6.  One final.  when our food was brought out on a tray  by a food server I noticed that she was carrying it  up high toward her right shoulder.  Lo and behold, her hair , that  was hanging down her back brushed across some of the food as she twisted to put the tray down.  I was so disgusted at that point by the  rudeness of the  hostess and the table setup issue that I just figured lets get this done  and over with.  I had suggested the place and if I had made a scene about the hair not being up and away from the food all the food on the tray would have gone back.  Considering the next events  I should have said something and we all should have left.   6.  When we got up to leave I spoke to the waitress.  I told her I was shocked by the Managers attitude about the dirty glass, all of us were disgusted.  She told me the Manager basically asked her why she did not see it herself.  The waitress was very upset.   7.  As we walked out the Manager tried to give us coupons to use when we returned.  I told her we would not be back, that my guests were disgusted and that I would be in touch with the family that owns the restaurant.   I am very disappointed and would not return, neither would the rest of my party and I will be following through in contacting the owners.",

            "rev_text": "I am extremely disappointed with my most recent experience at Kitchen Bar.   My two friends from Pittsburgh and I went to brunch there on Sunday. I was really excited to take them, since it's one of my favorite places. We were happy with our food- as always, but the service was abysmal.   We ordered the egg sandwich on a pretzel, Tex Mex omelet, and California omelet. Everything was very good.  Our waitress acted like we were deeply inconveniencing her every time we asked for anything...such as a refill, or ketchup, or really anything at all. She was rude and unpleasant, sighing when we asked her anything and storming away.   She FINALLY dropped off our check, and then we waited 20 minutes. She walked by...nothing. I finally had enough and went up to the front to take care of the bill, and then she appeared in a flash to take care of it...obviously because she was looking to enter her tips. I thought that was incredibly rude. I attempted to speak to the hostess about the service, but she was off in her own world and didn't really listen.   When she brought us the checks, she offered a half-hearted apology- which we knew was phony and in a last-ditch effort to get a decent tip.  I am tired of hearing the same lame excuses \"Oh, we just got so busy!\" I completely understand that, but being busy is not an excuse for being incredibly RUDE. She didn't even bring out our meals (someone else does that here), so she truly did nothing for our table without complaining about it.  One of my friends who joined me last Sunday had been a server for many years, and her husband actually is a restaurant manager in Pittsburgh. She also felt that the service was truly terrible- and we are not exactly the type of people who complain about servers since we do understand that it can be a high-stress job.  It was truly embarassing to take my close friends to this place and have it turn out this way. I will not be coming back to Kitchen Bar for a while, if ever- they need to fix their issues with speed of service, but more importantly, need to get some servers who don't act as if they hate people. When you provide VERY loyal customers with terrible service, you'll lose them- just like you've lost me.",

The water with an unwrapped straw stuck into the glass.  I asked the server how it got there.  She said \"my hands...of course I didn't touch the part that goes into your mouth\"  Huh!  What about the part that went into the water I was about to drink?  I ordered an Omelet ...it took a long time and was luke warm when it came out; potatoes were also cold; toast was so stale I was able to break it into small pieces (like bread crumbs); my husband got a waffle with fresh strawberries and bacon.  Waffle and bacon were also luke warm.  It was the same as my past experience.  Waitress pours coffee, takes order and disappears for a long time.  Never comes back with coffee refills (a real no no at breakfast).  I think the wait staff are probably allowed to carry cell phones and they start to text and forget the food ...there was no way my food could have been that cold and limp coming from the kitchen to my table unless it had sat much too long.  It wasn't worth getting another order ...I just shared with my husband and I'll never go back again.  Yes, I think they make their money from the bar and if they handle straws with their hands who knows what else is ok",

The description says \"Fresh warm crisp tortillas topped with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, onions, beans, tomatoes, cilantro, green peppers and fresh jalapeños, served with sour cream and guacamole, finished with ranchero sauce\" which we figured would be full sized tortillas, right? It was basically breakfast nachos. Good, but again not what we expected.  Our waitress looked bored-borderline annoyed at our presence.

The portions are hearty to say the least, but the food still isn't anything to write home about. I find the flavors to be muddled or hidden beneath too much spice. It's a good place for mom and dad to take the kiddies on a Saturday night. It's also popular with meat-head men and their dates looking to get trashed while they watch the latest game. The bar still allowed smoking as of my last trip and that was a major turn-off as the smoke tends to waft into the dining room.

            "rev_text": "I have been going to this place since it was Alexander's, It was good back then, but even better when they did a complete renovation and changed the name. Teh modern look, the cool indoor waterfall, the indoor/outdoor space was great! Since the change (many years ago) their parking lot is hardly ever empty and I've always enjoyed an adequate meal. Not amazing, but pretty good. Yes, the prices are high for the area, but I never minded because it was consistent.  Then, this morning happened.  I was in search of breakfast, and remembered their \"breakfast specials starting at 8:00 A.M\" sign. I was seated at a table which was filled with crumbs. I moved. I was given a menu which was sticky, dirty, and had no \"breakfast special\" on it. When I asked the bored, overly-perfumed server, her answer was, \"this is what we have\" and pointed to the menu. She asked me for my order. I ordered poached eggs and decaf. I finished my decaf a full 5 minutes before my meal came. I was offered regular, and had to stop the server before she poured it in my cup.   My meal arrived with cold toast, watered-down (I'm not kidding) poached eggs in a coffee cup, and another offer of regular coffee refill.  I won't even get started on my companion's meal. Not much better.  I had to call the server over to tell her. She responded with an appropriate \"I'll get you something else.\" I then got scrambled with the bottom piece of toast burnt. At least I saved myself some carbs!  I went to the restroom. It was like following Hansel and Gretel's route because of all the crumbs on the floor. And, the filth of the floor as though it hadn't been swept or cleaned in years. The bathroom was somewhat clean, but at that point I could hardly picture what the kitchen looked like.   And, I noticed the waterfall was not working.  Instead of an apology, I noticed my companion was charged for a cup of coffee. He didn't have coffee.  It's a shame, but I say...never again!",

I got the mussels and my other 2 coworkers got the chicken fingers and wings and none of us was about to finish our food. They make their drinks really yummy! Must try their specialty cocktails. They make their cocktails really good and it is strong enough to get the job done!

About 15 minutes later our appetizers and meal choices were taken by the waitress.  Our appetizers and soup arrived 15 minutes later along with the waitress informing us that 1 of the only 3 steaks they have on the menu isn't available.  My husband was extremely disappointed and was looking for a comparable substitute.  The waitress then said she would ask about a replacement and ended up sending the manager to our table.  The manager offered us a free dessert and we knew that'd be all they'd offer so we accepted.  Once we received the entrees, they we're ok, small portions, good flavor though.

A layer of sautéed spinach sits under the perfectly cooked egg and all rests on a toasted English muffin.  I was offered hash browns or grits as a side. I declined both. I would have preferred to receive a dish of fruit with this meal as an alternative. Just saying. The dish was cooked perfectly. And the crab was plentiful.  As always, I ordered a piece of scrapple which arrived a bit late, but I know scrapple takes a bit and the waitress wanted our food to arrive hot so all was forgiven.   One issue; one cup of coffee arrived with a big piece of onion skin in it. The waitress removed the cup immediately, but she dumped it, rinsed the cup and refilled the cup. You could tell cause the outside of the cup was dripping wet when she brought it refilled. WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A NEW CUP!  We were charged full price for the coffee btw.

I Dislike when servers give me my check when I'm not even half way done my food thats rude.When she returned with our change she literally threw the check book at us on table didn't say have a nice day nothing just walked away.

Once I told her I didnt order potatoes she brought out the smallest serving of grits I have ever had in my life. The toast was cold and didnt melt the butter so I had clumps of butter on the toast. The bacon tasted old, the coffee was tepid at best. I asked for grape jelly and she brings out 4 different kinds instead of JUST grape jelly.  Terrible food, terrible service. Now I remember why I stopped coming here. Thanks for the reminder. You are better off going somewhere, anywhere else.

The bar changed colors every 10 to 15 seconds, blue, green, etc. The surrounding were quiet, lots of space, and very comfortable.  The food is also wonderful. Nothing greasy, nothing that makes you feel your heart is having a stress exercise, but a nice American Traditional Meal. Nothing to leave on the side, unless you want to take it home, or its shells on a clam.  Salads are original, simple and good. They have mussels/clams w/ marinara or the special house sauce.  Recommend the special house sauce. A lot of the dinner specials are good as well. The desserts are really good and decorative as well. A great place to go with a group of friends.",

            "rev_text": "T and I were a little reluctant to try Kitchen Bar based on so many poor reviews. But in the interest of fairness, we gave it a shot and we had a really great experience! We had a bit of a problem finding a parking spot (the lot is disproportionately small compared to the size of the restaurant) but two tours of the parking lot did the trick. We didn't realize it was Restaurant Week but luckily there were plenty of tables and we were seated right away.  Our waitress was prompt taking our drink order and brought water along with our drinks without being asked. Love that. T ordered off the Restaurant Week menu. He started with a house salad with a side of (what we think was house made) bleu cheese. The salad was presented very nicely with thin cucumber slices forming a little wall that contained the greens. He followed up with the Margarita Beef Steak served with two black bean enchiladas. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned nicely. The enchiladas were packed full of beans, he could only finish one. He enjoyed everything very much.  I started with the Ahi Tuna Steak which was grilled and served on top of seaweed salad and cusabi sauce. I'm not exactly sure what cusabi sauce is (cucumber wasabi?) but it was DELICOUS with great hints of ginger. The tuna was cooked perfectly and was really tender and flavorful. There were also crispy wontons on top which added a great crunch. Very delicious. For dinner I had the grilled fish tacos (I love my seafood in the summer!) which were topped with pickled cabbage and lemon aioli. The lemon aioli was great with the fish. I think there was a little bay and cucumber salt mixed in and it was a great accent. The fish was tender and flaky.  For dessert we split T's Restaurant Week cheesecake. It was a bit of a thin slice which was disappointing since it was so creamy and tasty. I hate when cheesecake is dry and this did not disappoint. It was served with fresh berries and a caramel drizzle. Yum.  We will definitely be going back. There were several menu items we wanted to try and two desserts (the banana caramel xango and fried oreos a la mode) calling my name. Our server was friendly and the girly drinks the table next to us ordered looked fab. I'm not sure why this place gets such mediocre reviews. I hope we never find out ...",

The staff and management appear to lack any professional experience in this industry - and if they do, that is a plus.

I ordered the roast beef panini which had red peppers, onions, and cheese on it and came with a side caesar salad, which was a nice change of pace considering most places would bring you fries or chips with a sandwich.  While the sandwich wasn't that great (the beef was a little dry), the salad was crisp and refreshing.  I had come with two friends, one of them had ordered an omelet, which she said was bland and the other had ordered the KB Burger, which looked fantastic as he scarfed it down!   The reason for the three, considering my feelings towards lunch, is due entriely to the dessert menu.  Each of us ordered something different and each one, by our own accounts, thought they were fantastic.  I had the Kahlua and Toffee Cake which was very rich, but also very creamy and moist.  My other friends ordered the fried Oreos with ice cream, which by his drooling and hoarding had to be good, and the cinnamon cheesecake which was stuffed into a fried crust that tasted fantastic!  Overall, this place won't blow you away with their food but, if you can, stop by and get some coffee and dessert!",

The Fiji sunset was very tasty-just enough alcohol with a fruity flavor.  The rum punch was much stronger and tasted like...drum roll please...rum.  The spinach and artichoke was pretty standard but the nachos were huge.  The plate came out with a mound of cheese, peppers, olives with sides of salsa, guac and sour cream.  I ordered it for myself but it easily fed the three of us with more than 1/2 left over when we were done.  Our server Andre was very friendly and attentive.  We never needed/wanted for anything because he checked in frequently.  After we finished our apps we decided to move to the bar area for a couple more drinks and to listen to the music.  I forgot to mention-there is a dj on Friday and Saturday nights.  The bar area service was basically non existent. We waited at the bar table for 20 minutes and didn't get greeted or offered a drink menu. I saw who I thought was the manager walk by and said excuse me, we made eye contact and he kept walking.  Every table around us was served.  After waiting for so long we decided to leave and on the way out I saw the manager and took my chance.  Without speaking to the server he said the server thought we didn't want anything because we just had dinner.  When I asked why he ignored me he said he thought I was saying hi ‍.  He offered us a round of drinks as an apology.  We relented and sat back down.  We finished our free drinks and went on our way.",

I noticed the Cheese Steak Omelet on the menu which intrigued me, so I gave it a try. It was really good, the egg and cheese steak both well cooked. The side of hash browns on the other hand weren't very good. They were just shredded potatoes that had seen the flat top for maybe 30 seconds on one side. There wasn't anything added to them and they were barely crusted, they can definitely do better.   My wife had a craving for a BLT with a slice of avocado and cheese ... obviously that is not something normally on the menu, however they did their best to accommodate her. She had to settle for Guacamole in lieu of the avocado slice but she was definitely happy with her sandwich. She also got a side of fries which were pretty good.

As funny as this may sound, I'm hooked on the few appetizers I've had here and would love to try the rest of the appetizer menu. However in no way are the entrees lacking, rather it didn't leave me with a memorable experience as I have with the apps. In general everything else is wonderful. The decor and atmosphere is like a split between contemporary and fine dining. Servers do their job well, price is average for quality of food, and I've no complaints.",

Our waiter came over right away and took our drink orders. I ordered the Corn-beef Special  with a side of Sweet Potato fries and my girlfriend got the Portabella Burger with cheese and she loved it; we thought it was great for a nice lunch. We will most likely be back because we want to try the other food that the Kitchen Bar has to offer! Thanks for a great time! We will be back!",

            "rev_text": "UPDATE:  Took my dad here for dinner on Monday night for a belated Father's day dinner.  ONLY reason?  Because the whole place down the their plates and door handles is embellished with my dad's initials \"KB\" .  WHICH I thought was the ULTIMATE happy father's day!  [insert cheesy grin]  I have to say dinner was not that bad!  I had the special, veal chops with mash, and string beans.  YUMMIE. [  If you read a lot of my reviews you must be very sick of the YUMMIE ....  TOO BAD!!  =p]  Ms. Bellinda had the kids spaghetti [ \"no meat balls please\" says ms. Bellinda]  which surprisingly she LOVED.  Tuan had the KB steak with portebello mushrooms, steak was good [ tasted like steak ] , but I wasn't loving the sauce they had on it.  Simon had the sesame tuna, which was served with Jasmine rice.   Being Asian we found this HILARIOUS.  WHO has raw tuna with a bowl of rice?!  He wasn't happy with it, the flavor just wasn't there.  My dad had the tender beef steak, which was really good.  The steak was really *ahem* lack of a better word.  Tender.  =)  and there was no yucky sauce masking the yummy meat.  My mom had the tilapia with tomato cream sauce.  The sauce was bland, but the fish was done perfectly, it was served with a corn risotto, which was over cooked.  For appetizers we had the fried calamari served with blue cheese and hot sauce.  The calamari was fried to perfection, not too over cooked, but the hot sauce was disappointing.  It was regular Buffalo wing sauce.  We also had the mussels in marinara [ the mussels were not fresh and had a funny taste to it] , and we also had the tex mex with chili.  the tex mex was the best part of the meal I 'd have to say.  All appetizers were also HUGE.  As for the service, our server was Rachel, and she was great.  Totally made up for the time we went when we had STEVE.  Stay away from Steve if you want good service!  .................................................................................................  The look of this place is pretty impressive.  It's formally Alexander's [ which I'm not familiar with , but ask any Penn State Abington alum and they should know.] .  My acquaintances and I had lunch there on a recent Sunday afternoon.  Wait was not too bad.  We were given a beeper but waited no more then 5 minutes when we were called to be seated.  The place was PACKED.  Apparently we had gotten there just in time, because the groups that arrived after us, ended up having a wait time that was easily tripled ours.    The place's decor is cute and modern.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. All the service staff seemed to be courteous and efficient.  EXCEPT ours.  We waited a good 10 minutes before we were approached with and introduction and requests.   And then he seemed ANNOYED that we weren't ready to order.  [ In case your wondering, if your waiter is named Steve, asked to be moved  he is the main reason this place did not receive a higher rating from me.]   Food took forever to come out.  My girlfriend ordered the traditional turkey club.  I had the Grilled Reuben.  Roast beef, w/ sour kraut, on grilled rye with ranch dressing.  Bellinda had the kid's grilled cheese.  My sandwich I thought was great.  The fries that accompanied the meal was FANTASTIC.  Bellinda's grilled cheese...  Big disappointment.  To top off the meal?  It took STEVE another 15 minutes after we asked for the check for the check to actually get to us.  With our belly's full, our check only came to about $24.  IMPRESSIVE .  Place was nice, already have reservations to take my father there to try the dinner menu.  Will update then!",

It isn't too far from my grandmother's home and it had a nice diverse menu with a decent downtown ambience for a place in the county. But, my recent experience there has completely turned me off, I am no longer sure I can support them as much anymore.   My family wanted to celebrate a great accomplishment in my life and I decided to go to the Kitchen Bar, on a Sunday. Everything about the place seems to be the same but the food was horrible. We ordered a number of appetizers and the only ones that were good were the mussels and hot wings. The salad was decent but very short on the feta. I personally had the tuna steak and asked for it medium RARE and it came out well done. I didn't understand how that could occur and neither could the waitress, she seem to not be familiar what medium rare meant.   After the lunch, I asked everyone what they thought of their meals and they said it was \"lousy.\" I'm not sure if it was because it was a Sunday or what but I really was disappointed the Kitchen Bar had dropped so much in quality. I think I am going to give them some time off.   Fin.  -Madd (@MaddMack)",

We get to kb on time and say we have a reservation and they don't even have a table ready for us. Once we get to our table, we're ordering drinks and I ask what an \"antioxidant drink\" is (since it's on the menu twice) and turns out the waitress had no idea what I was talking about. She replied, \"ha I don't know. What IS an antioxidant drink?\" Uh it's on the menu twice... Turns out that was just a fancy name for \"juice\" but she should still know the menu better. Next, we're sitting there waiting for our nachos (which came out cold by the way) and see that every table has bread. We never got bread! So I ask a man who looked like the manager for bread after we already received our appetizer. He forgets and never brings it out to us. Then, after we get our entrees, I ask our waitress for bread and after a good 10 minutes, she finally brings us bread as we're finishing our dinner. We then see the hostesses putting out \"Reserved\" signs on atleast 3 different tables. I had a reservation and my table wasn't reserved! The whole dinner My boyfriend and I only talked about how horrible the service and food were. Our waitress never checked in on us and also never cleared our appetizer until we were finished our dinners. Needless to say NEVER going back and our tip reflected our disgust.",

Not a very inviting sight to start.  We were one of two tables in the entire restaurant tonight, and for good reason.  To start, we had to peel away at the filthy dirty menus to open them up. They need to be cleaned and replaced. Our hands were dirty from touching them.  We were sat at a table that had salt all over it, so that means it wasn't wiped down.  You'd think being one of two tables we'd have been greeted rapidly, not happening. We were sat by the window, and the ledge by the window was filthy, dirty, dusty and covered with food splatters dead flies.  Worst, we killed a half dozen crawling bugs on the table ourselves.  Food was as bad as the rest of the experience and we couldn't wait to get out of this dump!!",

My wife paid for our drinks and the one appetizer we received, even though it should have been gratis. We did get their lame apology as they took our money, but that place won't have to worry.

            "rev_text": "Well that was food.. ( no not a typo, there is no G deserved here but calling this food is also not really true, it was not really edible so calling it food is and alternate fact.  I've been here before and thought I recalled a decent experience, well this trip proved my memory wrong ( or that times have changed) Decor was well thought out, nice place but is getting rough around the edges, time for a little updates ( the restroom smelled a bit, looked dingy and the funky decor ( lights in the floor) have seen better days.  I got the Italian hoagie Panini,  I mean how hard is that. It came with choice of soup, I took french onion which was passable, not too salty and loaded with cheese.  So what is a panini at kitchen bar? A warmed up naan with slices of so very salty deli ham ( the cheap kind) stacked on top of each other, a few pieces of pepperoni and s bit of mozzarella cheese, and a crispy chicken finger sliced (yes sliced) thin that;s it. It was bad, really bad, I did not even eat half of it ( a very rare event for me) total waste of calories for the tasteless mess that was food...   Even the fries were horrible and how does one do that? Use fries made of chopped and pressed potato pieces formed into fry shapes instead of natural cut potatoes.   My companion had the peach caprese salad, it is peach season so one would expect some nice fresh peach slices on it, but no, There were a few mounds of gelatinous yellow blobs on the plate, which one might think could have been peaches in another life (or on another planet) but  were likely canned peaches of the cheapest (not natural) style. Add to that some flakes of what may have been dried dusty mozzarella (or chips of paint from the flaking walls. Add to that some wilted spinach and you get the Kitchen Bar version of Peach Caprese Salad, or as she said, plate of goo_ yes this is not a typo either, there is no D for good because Kitchen bar gets an F.",

            "rev_text": "My brother works just up the street from Kitchen Bar so we decided to give this play a try today. The outside look of the establishment is nice. I think I would like to retry this place in the spring for the outside area. I've heard many good things about Kitchen Bar and I've known quite a few people that have previously worked here who have all said great things too. So when it was brought up that we should go here I was all game. Ehh.  There were five of us in my party. My sister and dad ordered a cup of the chicken noodle and I ordered the cream of crab soup. Within ten minutes my waitress brought over my soup. It wasn't until then she decided to tell us they were out of chicken noodle. My sister and my Dad opted for the french onion soup which they both said was good. The cream of crab wasn't very good, sadly. It had a lot of onions in it for whatever reason which ended up just overwhelming it.   I will say when all of our entrees came out they were well presented. I can definitely appreciate a chef who takes the time to arrange and decorate a plate. For my entree I chose the sausage and pepper flatbread. It consisted of mozzarella, onions (A LOT), sausage, and fresh spinach on top. Did you notice how I didn't say peppers? The sausage and pepper flatbread had no peppers at all! How you manage to forget to put a main ingredient in a meal that has peppers in the title is beyond me. However, it wasn't a huge ordeal because the blend of everything else was fine. I would have appreciated a little less onions though.   Lastly, I appreciate when my waitress cracks a smile from time to time. Or at least acts like they want to be there! Nothing. No personality, no facial expression. Nothing. -- I really wouldn't say this place is bad. I just think I came on an off day.",

Parking lot is smaller and can get cramped when busy.  Final verdict- a nice place for the locals to hang with friends for a drink or 2 or a special occasion, but nothing that exciting to drive out to and too pricey to make this a regular pit stop otherwise.",

I also couldn't really find anything that sounded really appetizing, even though I was starving. I ended up with the cheesesteak spring rolls, which were ok, but nothing special.

I wish it was possible to give it zero stars.  I will never go back to this place, and I will have no problem sharing this experience with anyone I can. I'm wondering if other people who gave this place a less-than-stellar review (which is the majority of the reviews) have received similar messages from Carl W., or anyone else?   I didn't love Kitchen Bar the one time I was there, but I didn't loathe it. Apparently Carl W. thought it necessary to tell me, \"when you shit on a place you are essentially putting jobs of other human beings at risk.\" I don't think reviews are meant to be death sentences - they should simply be viewed as opportunities for business owners to look at for possible areas of improvement.    Yelp reviews reflect a personal experience with a business, which is why it works. I hope harassment like this doesn't discourage people from sharing their honest opinions.

The food is also overpriced and very inconsistent. On my 3 visits (when it first opened) where I wanted to give them a fair assessment and not base it on one visit, one consistent issue was poor service. The wait staff thinks they are doing you a favor taking your order. I wanted to be a customer because it's so close to home, not meant to be. And forget about bringing issues to the management for resolution. It falls on deaf ears. These guys own at least 5 restaurants in the local area. They are not customer service focused.",

The calamari was nicely breaded and didn't seem to be over cooked but for some reason it was chewy. I ordered the salmon salad which was amazing. It was served in a large bowl with slices of rolled cucumber, olives, fresh green mix, cherry tomato and cubed cheese. The salmon on top was cooked perfectly and was a generous portion. It came with two containers of a light dressing. My wife ordered the fish and chips. She said the fish was just okay, nothing special. I tasted a piece and it was equivalent to the box of beer battered cod I have at home in my freezer. The breeding was heavy and it wasn't very tasty. The French fries were good. The bartender made a good gin and tonic and later on we ordered a round of jolly ranchers for friends which were good. This is a good place for bar food. No dj this Friday. Place was pretty empty must be due to holiday weekend.",

The well lit dining room with a wall of windows is inviting and comfortable.  The noise level is often on the loud side as the raised industrial ceilings bounce chatter, crying children and noisy talkers throughout the room.  Menu is much like any other diner offering breakfast lunch dinners and deserts.  Full bar on one side of the building and dining area on the other side. Patio seating is available when weather permits.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Buffalo chicken salad served in the crispiest of tortilla bowls - just the right amount of spice topped upon a lush green salad with eggs tomatoes and more.  Too much for one sitting but delicious.   I have never had anything I didn't care for here and the staff is almost overly accommodating.  Servers are plentiful, friendly and eager to serve.  Prices run a little on the higher end but the service is worth it.",

It definitely sticks out along Old York Rd! Parking was fine, but a little bit tight. The staff was friendly enough.

They were not busy so I sat at the bar (a first for me) & ordered a Guinness on tap. I swear it was watered down & tasted a little soapy. I like dark beer & I like Guinness but this wasn't it. I ordered Cioppino (another first) off the menu & that was a mistake. What was I thinking or expecting from a bar! I had visions of a wonderful light broth with clams, mussels, shrimp, squid, tomatoes, fennel, garlic, etc. but instead was served a plate overflowing with angel hair pasta, diced tomatoes (they were nicely diced) a few shrimp & that is all I could see. The ugly mound of pasta had soaked up all the broth (what ever it was) & it was tasteless & certainly not what I had expected. I complained to the manager partly because the menu noted penne pasta but not a thin pasta that is entirely the wrong starch for this meal not that it needs one but mostly because it looked totally unappetizing. He took my plate away & I was eventually brought a plate with penne pasta & the rest of what ever was hidden by the other pasta. The taste didn't improve, I was offered no compensation but I did get to hear what the bar tender did over the weekend & why she only had 3 hours of sleep which explained why she couldn't remember what my other drink order was. I wonder if the Kitchen Bar has changed owners? The Greek family that opened it up originally as Alexander's were fantastic people & very warm. Not so much now & I'll try breakfast next to see if the down slide is universal or just the evening crew.",

            "rev_text": "The service we received last night was absolutely horrid. Our server basically \"grunted\" every time we spoke to her and she showed her dismay every time she had to fill our glasses with water. With me working in customer service and my sister being a server herself, we were truly disheartened by the way this employee acted. She just honestly seemed annoyed that she was there.. like why work as a waitress then?  When I go out anywhere, I expect to be treated kindly and professionally. This waitress \"Julia/Julie\" was honestly a nightmare. Which is a damn shame, bc we absolutely LOVED the food.   Her resting bitch face made it quite uncomfortable to have fun though. And then to top off the night. When \"Julie\" came back with the receipt, we had a question bc we believed there was an indiscretion. This woman continued to speak DISRESPECTFULLY to me and went on to say \"That charge is just known\" like excuse me? But I believe it's YOUR job to let me know when something so random or small will be an additional couple dollars. And she went on to explain \"you should know that.   THIS WOMAN LITERALLY SCOFFED AND SNORTED. It was THEE most uncomfortable situation ever. As I was walking out I looked for some type of manager. But I didn't want to make a big deal. I managed to let the hostess know of my night. She apologized. But I felt that Kitchen Bar should know of their disrespectful employees making their customers feel uncomfortable and/or unwelcome.   And I'm aware I may sound cheap, which I SWEAR I am not. I still left this horrible woman a decent tip. Because like I explained, my sister works as a server. Again, the food was really good, and the restaurant offers delicious healthier alternatives to original diner food. But this server, like I'm not a vengeful person.. but I can say this, this woman managed to make my 10 year old brother feel uncomfortable with her attitude. This grown woman had the ability to make her annoyance so clear, that my TEN YEAR OLD brother was able to pick up on her bitter attitude and behavior.   Sorry, again I feel bad about this, but I just HAD to put this out there.",

            "rev_text": "Great local place for a tasty and fresh American meal! I love coming here for lunch and dinner, and definitely a big meal. The burgers are juicy and delicious, sandwiches are good, and salads taste fresh. For dinner, the bourbon chicken is delicious! The portions are large, and flavors are on point.   There are good light and gluten free options, such as a burger with grilled veggies instead of a bun -- and the veggies are fantastic: grilled just enough that they're soft and warm, probably the most stand-out part for me as it's a twist on the usual burger! The bourbon chicken can also be ordered gluten free.  For drinks, I'd recommend the red sangria. There's happy hour specials, too!  The atmosphere is lively. Kitchen Bar a good place to go out to eat with friends, although it can get a little bit loud, especially on the weekends when there is music playing. There may be a bit of a wait on weekends, but the hostess is usually up-front about how long it will be. For lunch or a weekday dinner, you can get seated right away and it's a little quieter, but still a really fun spot -- especially with a few friends for dinner and drinks.  The waiters are friendly and happy to accommodate food allergies and preferences. Service is good, too. Overall, I've always had a really enjoyable experience here!",

We were here couple times and it was not that bad. We came in, the hostess was very nice. Ok, we proceeded to the bar and ordered a glass of wine and one beer....The waitress was extremely rude. She did not even attempt to smile and looked like she was mad at us for something. When she brought me my glass of wine, she almost threw it in front of me. I thought the glass would break...we were waiting for her to pay attention for another 20 minutes to get our food order ( the place was half empty). She did not and I guess her shift was over and she left. The other two guys stepped in but no one was still paying any attention. I saw a nice couple sitting next to us were discussing how bad the service is in that place. So we decided to leave. Horrible experience and absolutely terrible treatment. Will not be back.",

My wife ordered a gyro and she hated it. The pita was extra crispy, it pressed in a panini press,the pita should be soft. The whole gyro tasted like strong dill. Her salad was soggy. Very disappointing. The burgers were ok. The fries are good. The waitress was nice. The bill was way too over priced. We paid $70 for bad food.

The food was a little better than average, and certainly a higher quality than a Friday's or anything else around the way. We split a house specialty pizza and a Fish-N-Chips meal.

After hours, you can park down a back alley at the bank which holds maybe 6 cars.  The entrance is not really accessible to people with who have a hard time walking (climbing inclines).  If you park in one of the lot areas, you need to walk all the way around to the other side of the restaurant (up a incline where cars coming around blind curve then one to the door).  There is another entrance to this side of the restaurant, but it is alway locked for some reason.

            "rev_text": "I was really looking forward to having a good experience here but wow, what an epic failure. Before I throw this place under the bus, let me be clear, our server was a sweetheart and my experience was only due to horrible management and food. First soup came out cold. I thought I'll give it another try and hopefully entrees are better. Took over an hour to bring out a small pizza. It arrived under-cooked and tasted like gas station pizza..ughhhh.  I love pretty much most pizza, so the fact that I could not have more than a bite is saying something.   They use the cheapest and most horrible tasting ingredients.  Told the server to send it back. He knew I was disgusted. Normally they would offer something to fix it, or a manager would come over, but nada.  I asked to speak to the manager whose name was Ali I believe. What a jerk off this guy was. Non apologetic, arrogant, argumentative and told me if I didn't like it, send it back (which I had already done).  Sounded more like a prison warden then a manger of a restaurant. I should have read the reviews before going here to save me the aggravation. It's ok because I now know what bad service and food is.  I will never go back or recommend this dump to anyone.    My apologies if this seems harsh but I value my time and money. If I am willing to come to your establishment when there are endless options to choose from, please be kind to your customers and listen instead of arguing and talking down to them.",

We had a reservation for 7, there was live music, we were kindly greeted, given a complimentary appetizer, our server was awesome! Very alert and on top of our drinks and orders. Food came out surprisingly quickly for such a large party. I had the tuna steak and I loved every bite of it. Followed by the Creme brûlée, it was outstanding! Literally perfect!",

            "rev_text": "Was hankering for brunch recently driving down 611 in Abington.  I always see a full parking lot here so I decided to give it a try. One word...wow. It was bustling with business but I was seated right away.  I ordered a Bloody Mary Ann my server Margaret told me it was the best I would ever have. I laughed. As somewhat of a Bloody Mary snob I expected to be dissaponted as usual but nope...AMAZING bloody!!! Well balanced house made and complete with bacon!! Delicious. I ordered the lox platter to eat and again was blown away. Very nice portion of lox and all the required fixins-tomato, cucumber, capers, olives and cream cheese.  All in all a great experience and I think the beginning of a regular relationship. Margaret was amazing, somehow being super attentive and friendly while apparently managing/hosting the restaurant at the same time. A real pro. I highly recommend!!",
